\title{BlightR model.}
\usage{
BlightR(data, max_na = NULL, temporal_res = "daily",
  model_parameters = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The weather data formated as \code{data frame}.}

\item{max_na}{Maximum proportion of missing values. Set to 0.01 by default.}

\item{temporal_res}{By default, the teporal resolution of the output is daily. By changing the argument \code{temporal_res = "hourly"} user will get daily values attached at 12.}

\item{model_parameters}{resoulution of the final data to be returned, daily or hourly. If hourly is selected, outputst are returned at noon.}
}
\value{
This function returns a \code{data.frame} including columns:
\itemize{
 \item date Date formated as "yyyy-mm-dd"
 \item spor Sporulation risk.
 \item spor_cond Conditions for sporulation.
 \item inf Infection risk.
 \item surv_prob Spore mortality.
 \item risk_si Risk as sum of infection and sporulation reduced by moratlity.
 \item risk_mi
 \item risk Risk as product of sporulation, spore survival and infection.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates potato late blight risk using BlightR model.
The risk needs to be calculated for a single location, so if the
calculation is necessary for multiple locations, data for each location needs to
run separately.
